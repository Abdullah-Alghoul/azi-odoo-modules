        Calculate and manage material requirements plan data, per MRP standards.
        We will implement an efficient mrp algorithm.
        Since this is MRP-1, it has all the usual problems of MRP:
            - infinite capacity assumption
            - zero delay for internal moves
            - data integrity (garbage in, garbage out)
            - nervousness
            - bullwhip effect
        But, it fixes the problems with the standard Odoo scheduler:
            - low-level coding
            - time phasing / buckets
            - plan modification
