===================
MRP Master Schedule
===================

This module provides a master schedule of independent demand/supply, to be used in Material Requirements Planning.  Planning procurements from a master schedule allows the user to make changes to independent demand/supply.  This avoids the complications of using make-to-stock MOs to plan for the components.

Planned orders for dependent demand, resulting from master schedule entries are created after the old MRP plan is purged, but before the planning algorithm begins.
